# DOAC monitoring - recent change in NICE monitoring from 6 monthly to 4 monthly in >75s + frailty - does anyone know what the benefit of this is to patients? Does 4 monthly monitoring actually improve patient outcomes vs 6 monthly? Is there available evidence for this? What is the rationale

The recent change in NICE monitoring guidance for Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) from six-monthly to four-monthly intervals for patients aged over 75 years and those with frailty is aimed at improving patient safety and outcomes. Below is an analysis of the rationale, potential benefits, and evidence supporting this change:

## **Rationale for the Change**

1. **Age and Frailty-Related Risks**: Older adults and frail patients are at higher risk of complications such as renal impairment, bleeding, or other adverse effects due to DOAC therapy. Frequent monitoring allows earlier detection of changes in renal function, liver function, or haemoglobin levels, which can significantly impact the safety and efficacy of anticoagulation therapy[^1_1][^1_2].
2. **Renal Function Monitoring**: Renal function tends to decline with age, and impaired renal clearance can lead to increased drug accumulation, raising the risk of bleeding. The Cockcroft-Gault formula is recommended for calculating creatinine clearance, as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can overestimate renal function in elderly patients[^1_2].
3. **Dynamic Health Changes**: Frail patients often experience intercurrent illnesses or changes in concomitant medications that may affect hepatic or renal function. More frequent reviews ensure timely adjustments in DOAC dosing or therapy[^1_2][^1_3].

## **Potential Benefits to Patients**

1. **Improved Safety**: By identifying risks such as worsening renal impairment or bleeding tendencies earlier, four-monthly monitoring reduces the likelihood of adverse events like major bleeding or stroke due to inappropriate dosing[^1_1][^1_3].
2. **Optimized Therapy**: Frequent reviews allow healthcare providers to reassess adherence, side effects, and modifiable risk factors (e.g., blood pressure control), ensuring that the benefits of anticoagulation outweigh potential harms[^1_3].
3. **Enhanced Patient Engagement**: Regular monitoring appointments may improve patient education about DOAC therapy, adherence, and reporting of symptoms or side effects[^1_4].

## **Evidence Supporting Four-Monthly Monitoring**

While specific studies comparing four-monthly versus six-monthly monitoring intervals are not cited in the reviewed guidelines, the change aligns with broader recommendations from organizations like the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA). These guidelines emphasize more frequent monitoring for high-risk groups, including elderly and frail patients, due to their vulnerability to complications[^1_2][^1_3]. Additionally:

- Renal function monitoring intervals are often guided by creatinine clearance values (e.g., dividing CrCl by 10 for frequency in months), highlighting the need for individualized approaches[^1_2].
- Evidence extrapolated from studies on warfarin suggests that anticoagulation benefits generally outweigh risks unless there are significant contraindications like severe renal impairment or high fall risk[^1_1][^1_4].


## **Does Four-Monthly Monitoring Improve Outcomes?**

Although direct comparative evidence between four-monthly and six-monthly monitoring intervals is lacking:

- The rationale is grounded in clinical observations that more frequent checks allow timely intervention in high-risk populations.
- Improved detection of changes in renal or hepatic function may reduce complications such as bleeding events or thromboembolism.

In summary, while definitive data on outcome improvements with four-monthly monitoring are not available, the approach is supported by expert consensus and clinical guidelines emphasizing proactive management in vulnerable populations. Further research may be needed to quantify its impact on patient outcomes directly.
